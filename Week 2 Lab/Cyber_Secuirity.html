    <p style="font-size: 18">
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cyber security is the application of technologies,
      processes, and controls to protect systems, networks, programs, devices
      and data from cyber attacks. It aims to reduce the risk of cyber attacks
      and protect against the unauthorised exploitation of systems, networks,
      and technologies.
    </p>
    <h2>Why is cybersecurity important?</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        With an increasing number of users, devices and programs in the modern
        enterprise, combined with the increased deluge of data -- much of which
        is sensitive or confidential -- the importance of cybersecurity
        continues to grow. The growing volume and sophistication of cyber
        attackers and attack techniques compound the problem even further.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>What are the top cybersecurity challenges?</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        One of the most problematic elements of cybersecurity is the evolving
        nature of security risks. As new technologies emerge, and as technology
        is used in new or different ways, new attack avenues are developed.
        Keeping up with these frequent changes and advances in attacks, as well
        as updating practices to protect against them, can be challenging.
        Issues include ensuring all elements of cybersecurity are continually
        updated to protect against potential vulnerabilities. This can be
        especially difficult for smaller organizations without the staff or
        in-house resources.

      <tr>
        <td style="text-align: center">Malware</td>
        <td>
          Malware is a program inserted into a system to compromise the
          confidentiality, integrity, or availability of data. It is done
          secretly and can affect your data, applications, or operating system.

      <tr>
        <td style="text-align: center">Ransomware</td>
        <td>
          Ransomware prevents or limits users from accessing their system via
          malware. Ransomware asks you to pay a ransom using online payment
          methods to regain access to your system or data.

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td style="text-align: center">DDoS Attacks</td>
        <td>
          DDoS attacks make an online service unavailable by overwhelming it
          with excessive traffic from many locations and sources. Website
          response time slows down, preventing access during a DDoS attack.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td style="text-align: center">Spam & Phishing</td>
        <td>
          Spam includes unwanted, unsolicited, or undesirable messages and
          emails. Phishing is a form of social engineering, including attempts
          to get sensitive information. Phishing attempts will appear to be from
          a trustworthy person or business.

      <tr>
        <td style="text-align: center">Corporate Account Takeover</td>
        <td>
          CATO is a business entity theft where cyber thieves impersonate the
          business and send unauthorized wire and ACH transactions. The
          unauthorized funds are sent to accounts controlled by the cyber
          criminal.
